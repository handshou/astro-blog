This app is designed for web usage to tackle the hassle of arranging a 
suitable time for group meetings. We found that a common time is difficult to
find when there are three or more group members.

Using a timetabling solution which almost all NUS students are familiar with,
we built a meeting scheduling notebook. 

This project looks at similar aspects
as whenisgood.net and aims to provide better user-friendly features at no cost!
